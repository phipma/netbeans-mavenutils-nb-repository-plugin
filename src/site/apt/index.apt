NetBeans Repository plugin

 The plugin is capable of populating the local or remote maven repository with module jars and NBM files from a given NetBeans installation. Useful for
module development, modules with public APIs are separated from those without a public API.
See the {{{./populate-mojo.html}<<<populate>>>}} goal and the {{{./repository.html}HOWTO document}} for details.

 {{{https://search.maven.org/}Maven Central}} contains artefacts of Apache NetBeans 9.0 and later.

 Also see: {{{http://wiki.netbeans.org/NetBeansDeveloperFAQ#Mavenized_Builds}Maven NBM development FAQs}}

Older NetBeans Version

 To get access to a repository with NetBeans.org module artifacts and metadata, add {{{http://bits.netbeans.org/maven2/}http://bits.netbeans.org/maven2/}} repository to your project POM
or the repository manager you are using. The repository hosts binaries from NetBeans 6.5 to NetBeans 8.2.
