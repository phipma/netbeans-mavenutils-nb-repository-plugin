HOWTO: Upload NetBeans release binaries to a Maven repository


 There is a goal that converts the NetBeans module information into Maven metadata
and is capable of uploading the module jar file, javadoc, sources and nbm files to local
and remote repositories. See {{{./populate-mojo.html}<<<populate>>> goal}} description.

 For a binary-only upload (jar files and nbm files only), it's possible to download the bits from official sites. 
See this page {{{http://netbeans.apache.org/download/dev/index.html}Building from source}}

 For the complete upload, you will need to checkout the sources of the IDE/Platform you
want to upload. See this page {{{http://netbeans.apache.org/download/dev/index.html}Building from source}}

 To have external dependencies correctly identified by their real GAV, you will need to download the index from central (or other) repository. 
See {{{./download-mojo.html}<<<download>>> goal}}

 The goal has multiple input parameters that link the goal to binaries prepared beforehand.

   * <<netbeansInstallDirectory>> designates the base directory where resides the NetBeans installation
that shall be uploaded. Run <<<ant>>> in your local git clone to build the distribution at <<<nbbuild/netbeans>>> subdirectory.

   * <<netbeansNbmDirectory>> designates the base directory where the nbm files are located.
Run <<<ant build-nbms>>> in your local <<<git clone>>> to build the nbms at <<<nbbuild/nbms>>> directory.

   * <<netbeansSourcesDirectory>> designates the base directory containing zip files with module jar sources.
Run <<<ant build-source-zips>>> in your local hg clone to build the nbms at <<<nbbuild/build/source-zips>>> directory.

   * <<netbeansJavadocDirectory>> designates the base directory containing zip files with javadoc zips for modules with public apis.
Run <<<ant build-javadoc>>> in your local hg clone to build the nbms at <<<nbbuild/build/javadoc>>> directory.
